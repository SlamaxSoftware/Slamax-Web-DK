A ligthweigth fast and powerfull Web API made in pure Php. 
Is capable of forging websites and online apps, it is full cross platform and cross browser.

SlamaxWebDK comes with a fast and reliable Template system,
and a Theme based style system.

SlamaxWebDK it is not a classical Php API, infact
it us not only capable of processing server side code
and logic, but also server side?

### Why would i use SlamaxWebDK?

Programming website is becoming more complex, a lot
of old frameworks needed the developer to know
some Css and Javascript in order to use it properly,
so a lot of solutions came up these years
that allows to combine server, template and style
logic altogheter.
