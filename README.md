some Css and Javascript in order to use it properly,
so a lot of solutions came up these years
that allows to combine server, template and style
logic altogheter.

SlamaxWebDK is the Php solutions, because is capable of serializing
Css and Javascript calls, thanks to the SlsmaxObject class,
wich comes with a prebuilt event system that allows

any content, doesn't have a scripting system  and is not any kind of 
virtual machine, instead, it binds syntactic
feature directly into default php methods, so you can
just call the functions you need, and it fills
a buffer with fully specialied code.
It has a built in caching system wich furtermore 
increases performances.
